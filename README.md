Water Quality Prediction Project 
# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is built as part of the AICTE × Edunet Foundation × Shell internship.  
The goal is to predict the potability of water (safe/unsafe) using machine learning techniques based on its chemical characteristics.

📌 Problem Statement:
Traditional methods of water testing are manual, time-consuming, and expensive.  
This project uses a supervised ML model to automate the prediction of water quality based on physicochemical parameters.

🧠 Project Objectives:
- Build a predictive model for water potability classification
- Preprocess environmental datasets (cleaning, normalization)
- Apply machine learning algorithms for real-world sustainability applications
- Evaluate and interpret model performance
- Prepare for real-time deployment (future scope)

⚙️ Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib  
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score  

📊 Methodology:
1. Data preprocessing (null removal, normalization)  
2. Feature selection (correlation-based)  
3. Model training and testing  
4. Evaluation using regression metrics  
5. Visualization of results

✅ Results:
- **Accuracy:** ~93%  
- **Key Features:** BOD, DO, PO₄, NO₃  
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- Achieved consistent prediction performance across test data

🚀 Future Scope:
- Deploy the model as a web application using **Streamlit**  
- Integrate with **IoT sensors** for real-time water quality alerts  
- Extend the dataset to support multi-region and multi-source prediction
